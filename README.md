# PCA-for-portfolio-optimization
In this project, Principal Component Analysis, a dimensionality reduction technique is used to obtain multiple portfolios consisting of Net Asset Value (NAV) of Mutual Funds.<br>
The obtained portfolios are uncorrelated to each other and independent of each other, thus performance of any portfolio is not affected by the performance of any other.<br>
The performance of the portfolios is evaluated using Sharpe's Ratio.<br>
The resulting portfolios can be used for diversification of portfolios, thereby reducing the risk.<br>
